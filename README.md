# api_wordlist
A wordlist of API names used for fuzzing web application APIs.

## Contents
* api_seen_in_wild.txt - This contains API function names I've seen in the wild.
* actions.txt - API function name verbs
* objects.txt - API function name nouns
* preambles.txt - Common API function name preambles that may occur prior to verbs or nouns

## Usage
 1. In burpsuite, send an API request you want to fuzz to Intruder. 
 2. Remove the existing API function call, and replace it with two ยง characters for each text file you want to use for fuzzing.
 3. On the "Positions" tab, set Attack type to "Cluster Bomb" 
 4. On the "Payloads" tab, select 1 for the fist Payload set drop-down, then select a Payload type of "Runtime file" and navigate to the directory you downloaded these text files to. Select "preambles.txt".
 5. Repeat step 4 by setting Payload set 2 to "actions.txt" and Payload set 3 to "objects.txt"
 6. (optional step - add more payload sets and set them to "objects.txt" to test for multi-part objects like "UserAccount")
 7. Start attack

## Comments
If you use this and it's helpful, I'd love to hear about it! (@dagorim). If you think I've missed any obvious word choices, I'd love to hear about that as well, or feel free to add them.
